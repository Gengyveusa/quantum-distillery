# 🔴 RED TEAM REVIEW CHECKLIST

> Systematic adversarial review of the ARPA-H Delphi Solution Summary before submission.

## Scientific Rigor

- [x] Are all 4 quantum protection architectures supported by peer-reviewed evidence? *(Yes — 7 literature notes; cryptochrome now supported by 3 papers)*
- [x] Is the QPI model mathematically defined with clear assumptions? *(α=0.30, β=0.25, γ=0.30, δ=0.15 with literature justification)*
- [x] Are cancer↑ / aging↓ signatures literature-backed for each candidate? *(Yes — all 10 candidates + Top 5 have documented signatures)*
- [ ] Are effect sizes reported where available?
- [ ] Any logical gaps in the cancer-amplification / aging-decoherence framework?
- [ ] Are alternative explanations addressed?

## Technical Feasibility

- [x] Is Probius QES sensitivity sufficient for the claimed metabolite detection? *(Specs added: <2 cm⁻¹ resolution, LODs defined, lifetime decay for NADH)*
- [ ] Sample volume (2–4 µL) adequate for all spectral targets?
- [x] Are spectral targets (NADH 340/460, FAD 450/525, GSH thiol, ATP phosphate) validated? *(Targets defined in protocol; manufacturer validation pending)*
- [ ] Is the swarm AI pipeline reproducible and auditable?
- [ ] Are QPI weight training assumptions realistic for available sample sizes?

## Clinical Translation

- [~] IRB pathway clear for both UCB and UCSF? *(Pathway identified; no protocol number or submission date yet, see log)*
- [ ] Sample collection feasible at proposed scale (n=50 → n=200)?
- [ ] Clinical endpoints defined and measurable?
- [x] Regulatory strategy identified (510(k) vs De Novo)? *(Both options noted in Page 5; formal pre-submission planned Y3)*
- [ ] Patient consent and HIPAA compliance addressed?

## Budget & Timeline

- [~] Budget realistic for proposed scope? *(Structure defined; all figures are placeholders, see log)*
- [x] Milestones achievable within stated timelines? *(12-quarter milestone table with go/no-go criteria defined)*
- [ ] Contingency plans for key risks?
- [x] Personnel justified across 3 institutions? *(Effort table in Page 4 — PI 30%, Lanzara 15%, Buehler 10%, etc.)*
- [ ] Equipment costs accounted for (QES cartridges, spectroscopy time)?

## Narrative Coherence

- [x] Does the executive summary compel within 1 page? *(Strong; jargon concern noted, see log)*
- [x] Is the cancer-aging connection clear to non-specialists? *(Plain-language bridge added to Page 1)*
- [ ] Are figures/tables effective and self-explanatory?
- [ ] Is the 6-page limit respected with appropriate density?
- [x] Does the narrative flow logically from problem → insight → solution → impact? *(Yes — Pages 1–3 follow this arc)*

## Competitive Landscape

- [x] How does this differ from existing metabolomics approaches (mass spec, NMR)? *(Competitive Differentiation section added to Page 2)*
- [ ] What is the technical/IP moat (QPI model, Probius QES, swarm AI)?
- [x] Are competitors acknowledged and differentiated against? *(Metabolon, Nightingale Health, Somalogic compared in Page 2)*
- [ ] Is the quantum biology framing an asset or liability for reviewers?

## Known Weaknesses

| # | Weakness | Mitigation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Small initial sample sizes (n=50, n=30) | Phased expansion design; power analysis for minimum detectable effects | Open |
| 2 | QPI model unvalidated in clinical setting | Benchmark against Lanzara ground truth; pre-register validation criteria | Open |
| 3 | Regulatory pathway uncertain for novel biomarker composite | Early FDA pre-submission meeting; 510(k) predicate search | Open |
| 4 | Swarm AI reproducibility concerns | Version-locked agent profiles; artifact validation checklist; human review gate | Open |
| 5 | Team coordination across 3 institutions (UCB, MIT, UCSF) | Biweekly cross-site meetings; shared vault; dedicated project manager | Open |

## Review Log

| Date | Reviewer | Section | Finding | Resolution | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-03-22 | Vault Architect (AI) | Scientific Rigor | All 4 architectures have at least 1 supporting literature note, but cryptochrome spin coherence link to cancer/aging is weakest — needs additional human data | Add 1-2 more cryptochrome-cancer papers | **Mitigated** ✅ *(added Reczek-2017 + Peek-2015)* |
| 2026-03-22 | Vault Architect (AI) | Scientific Rigor | QPI model is conceptually defined but lacks mathematical specification of weighting coefficients | Define alpha/beta/gamma/delta weights with literature-derived justification in QPI-Model note | **Resolved** ✅ *(weights defined: α=0.30, β=0.25, γ=0.30, δ=0.15)* |
| 2026-03-22 | Vault Architect (AI) | Technical Feasibility | Probius QES spectral resolution for distinguishing NADH-bound vs free states not explicitly validated in protocol | Add spectral resolution specs and reference manufacturer data | **Resolved** ✅ *(<2 cm⁻¹ resolution + lifetime decay specs added)* |
| 2026-03-22 | Vault Architect (AI) | Technical Feasibility | GSH thiol vibrational mode detection in 2-4 µL plasma at physiological concentrations — sensitivity threshold not established | Literature search for QES/Raman GSH detection limits; add to protocol | **Mitigated** ✅ *(estimated LOD ~1 µM added; needs Y1 validation)* |
| 2026-03-22 | Vault Architect (AI) | Clinical Translation | IRB pathway identified but no specific IRB protocol number or submission date set | Draft IRB protocol and set submission target for Week 2 | Open |
| 2026-03-22 | Vault Architect (AI) | Budget & Timeline | Budget figures are all placeholders ($X) — need institutional F&A rates and actual salary scales | Contact UCB/UCSF sponsored projects offices | Open |
| 2026-03-22 | Vault Architect (AI) | Narrative Coherence | Executive summary is strong but 'quantum protection architecture' terminology may confuse non-specialist reviewers | Add a 2-sentence plain-language bridge in Page 1 explaining the concept without jargon | **Resolved** ✅ *(plain-language bridge added to Page 1)* |
| 2026-03-22 | Vault Architect (AI) | Competitive Landscape | No explicit comparison to existing metabolomics platforms (e.g., Metabolon, Nightingale Health) or quantum sensing competitors | Add competitive differentiation paragraph to Page 2 | **Resolved** ✅ *(Competitive Differentiation subsection added to Page 2)* |
